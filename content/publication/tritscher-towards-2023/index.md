abstract: Occupational fraud within companies currently causes losses of around 5%
  of company revenue each year. While enterprise resource planning systems can enable
  automated detection of occupational fraud through recording large amounts of company
  data, the use of state-of-the-art machine learning approaches in this domain is
  limited by their untraceable decision process. In this study, we evaluate whether
  machine learning combined with explainable artificial intelligence can provide both
  strong performance and decision traceability in occupational fraud detection. We
  construct an evaluation setting that assesses the comprehensibility of machine learning-based
  occupational fraud detection approaches, and evaluate both performance and comprehensibility
  of multiple approaches with explainable artificial intelligence. Our study finds
  that high detection performance does not necessarily indicate good explanation quality,
  but specific approaches provide both satisfactory performance and decision traceability,
  highlighting the suitability of machine learning for practical application in occupational
  fraud detection and the importance of research evaluating both performance and comprehensibility
  together.
