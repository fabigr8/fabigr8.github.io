abstract: Even though companies store large amounts of business data in enterprise
  resource planning (ERP) systems, obtaining data for financial fraud detection is
  prohibitively difficult due to privacy concerns and companies protecting trade secrets.
  One possible solution is game-based generation of synthetic ERP data, which poses
  the challenge of designing an environment that generates realistic ERP data and
  allows players to commit many different types of fraud. In this work, we design
  a multiplayer game that allows players to cooperatively run a fictional company,
  while simultaneously challenging them to maximize their personal gain. We introduce
  an approach for letting players explore fraud scenarios through emergent gameplay
  and present a prototype that may be primed with information from real world ERP
  systems to generate realistic data.
