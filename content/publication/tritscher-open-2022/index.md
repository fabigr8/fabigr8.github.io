abstract: Recent estimates report that companies lose 5% of their revenue to occupational
  fraud. Since most medium-sized and large companies employ Enterprise Resource Planning
  (ERP) systems to track vast amounts of information regarding their business process,
  researchers have in the past shown interest in automatically detecting fraud through
  ERP system data. Current research in this area, however, is hindered by the fact
  that ERP system data is not publicly available for the development and comparison
  of fraud detection methods. We therefore endeavour to generate public ERP system
  data that includes both normal business operation and fraud. We propose a strategy
  for generating ERP system data through a serious game, model a variety of fraud
  scenarios in cooperation with auditing experts, and generate data from a simulated
  make-to-stock production company with multiple research participants. We aggregate
  the generated data into ready to used datasets for fraud detection in ERP systems,
  and supply both the raw and aggregated data to the general public to allow for open
  development and comparison of fraud detection approaches on ERP system data.
