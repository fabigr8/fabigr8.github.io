abstract: The volatile digital economy forces enterprises to tap into the potential
  of data-driven decision-making. Accordingly, proactive management of business processes
  is increasingly gaining momentum in information system research. In addition to
  the superior model performance of predictive models, the explainability of deep
  learning models becomes a crucial requirement for real-world applications. Although
  recent works on explainable predictive business process monitoring propose various
  explainability approaches, preliminary research has been conducted on evaluating
  explanations regarding their faithfulness. Since human-created ground truth for
  evaluating algorithms is often unavailable or subjective, objective metrics are
  needed to assess the faithfulness of explanations. We contribute to this research
  gap by quantitatively and qualitatively investigating the capabilities of different
  explainability methods for Graph Convolutional Neural Networks in the context of
  outcome prediction.
