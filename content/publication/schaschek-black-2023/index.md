abstract: The volatile digital economy forces enterprises to tap into the potential 
  of data-driven decision-making. Accordingly, proactive management of business processes 
  is increasingly gaining momentum in information system research. In addition to the 
  superior model performance of predictive models, the explainability of deep learning 
  models becomes a crucial requirement for real-world applications. Although recent 
  works on explainable predictive business process monitoring propose various 
  explainability approaches, preliminary research has been conducted on evaluating 
  explanations regarding their faithfulness. Since human-created ground truth for 
  evaluating algorithms is often unavailable or subjective, objective metrics are
  needed to assess the faithfulness of explanations. We contribute to this research
  gap by quantitatively and qualitatively investigating the capabilities of different
  explainability methods for Graph Convolutional Neural Networks in the context of
  outcome prediction.

summary: In our paper we investigating the capabilities of different explainability methods for GNNs
