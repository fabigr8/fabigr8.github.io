abstract: In our work, we propose the use of Representational Similarity Analysis
  (RSA) for explainable AI (XAI) approaches to enhance the reliability of XAI-based
  decision support systems. To demonstrate how similarity analysis of explanations
  can assess the output stability of post-hoc explainers, we conducted a computational
  evaluative study. This study addresses how our approach can be leveraged to analyze
  the stability of explanations amidst various changes in the ML pipeline. Our results
  show that modifications such as altered preprocessing or different ML models lead
  to changes in the explanations and illustrate the extent to which stability can
  suffer. Explanation similarity analysis enables practitioners to compare different
  explanation outcomes, thus monitoring stability in explanations. Alongside discussing
  the results and practical applications in operationalized ML, including both benefits
  and limitations, we also delve into insights from computational neuroscience and
  neural information processing.
