As a Ph.D. candidate at the [University of W√ºrzburg](https://www.uni-wuerzburg.de/en/) my research focuses on the creation of social cognitive computing systems, especially applied Machine Learning, Deep Learning, GraphML and XAI methods to aid and enhance decision making. Furthermore, I am eager to explore and understand the impact of algorithm based decision making on societal dynamics, businesses, and individual behaviors. My approach incorporates a blend of qualitative, quantitative, and computational research methodologies.

Following my master's degree in 2014, I worked in the IT consultancy sector, specializing in advanced planning and optimization within Supply Chain Networks. This role provided me the opportunity to collaborate with multinational corporations, including BMW, Daimler, Osram, and Thyssen Krupp, delivering IT-Solutions, Algorithms and Technical Concepts. In 2019, After 4 years, I transitioned back into academia, commencing my doctoral studies at my alma mater. My doctoral research has been particularly focused on two projects. Project "DeepScan" focused on algorithm theory, computational complexity, and the explainability of machine learning algorithms in the context of anomaly detection. Project "PipeAI" focused on harnessing Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) to predict and analyze industrial processes.
