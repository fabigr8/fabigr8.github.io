location: Hugo Blox Builder HQ
address:
  street: Lohrtalweg 10
  city: Mosbach
  region: BY
  postcode: '74821'
  country: GER

summary: Classic Operations 
abstract: 'The module is an OR introductions course with lectures on different solution approaches e. g. for linear optimization or graph problems. The lecture is supported through several tutorials with manual excercises and jupyter notebooks (can be found in my github https://github.com/fabigr8).

Outline:
    - Intro OR: origin and distinction from other fields like Stochastics and Machine Learning, P vs. NP problems, distinction between solution, search and decision.
    - Linear Optimisation I: Practical relevance, problem definition, simple solution, graphical solution
    - Linear Optimisation II: Simplex, interpretation and limitations
    - Graph Theory I: Practical relevance, problem definition, design of graphs, shortest paths in graphs
    - Graph theory II: Minimally exciting trees, Network technique
    - Simulation: Practical relevance, problem definition, simulation theory, techniques (f.e. generation of random numbers, Monte Carlo simulation)
    - Transport Problems I: Introduction to transport problems, Stepping Stone Method, North West Corner Method
    - Transport problems II: MODI method, linear assignment problem
    - Combinatorial and integer Optimisation I: Combinatorial and Integer Optimisation, Branch and Bound, Greedy Algorithm,
    - Combinatorial and integer Optimisation II: heuristic solution methods based on the knapsack problem / travelling salesman problem
    - Outlook and exam preparation: Outlook OR (Evolutionary Algorithms, Theorems of EA and EA for the Verification of OR solutions, OR and Machine Learning), exam preparation.

Slides can be added in a few ways:

- **Create** slides using Hugo Blox Builder's [_Slides_](https://docs.hugoblox.com/reference/content-types/) feature and link using `slides` parameter in the front matter of the talk file
- **Upload** an existing slide deck to `static/` and link using `url_slides` parameter in the front matter of the talk file
- **Embed** your slides (e.g. Google Slides) or presentation video on this page using [shortcodes](https://docs.hugoblox.com/reference/markdown/).

Further event details, including [page elements](https://docs.hugoblox.com/reference/markdown/) such as image galleries, can be added to the body of this page.
